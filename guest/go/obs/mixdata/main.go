// Command bbb-mix-test-data is the `bbb-mix-test` observer's DATA STAGE: a
// second wasm module packaged beside it by `fklua mod --data-module`, exactly as
// the shipped mod's own data guest is (guest/go/data).
//
// It is the harness's own kit, and there is one thing in it -- the same one
// thing every other suite's kit has, for the same reason. See obs/obsdata, which
// is where that one thing lives now that six suites need it, and obs/protos,
// which is where the NAME lives so that this module and obs/mix can both have
// it without sharing an import.
//
// A data guest has NO RUNTIME API -- there is no `game`, no `script` and no
// entities at this stage -- so it imports fkdata and never fkapi, and packaging
// refuses one that does otherwise.
